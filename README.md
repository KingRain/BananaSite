# 🍌 Chaos By Design - The Most Frustrating Yet Usable Web App 💀

Welcome to **Chaos By Design**, where UI/UX nightmares come to life! 😈 This is part of a competition where the goal is to *intentionally* create the most frustrating yet technically functional web app.

> 🚀 "You can use it... if you dare!"

## 🔥 Features (Or Should We Say "Sufferings")
| **Feature** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| ✍️ *Self-Destructive Input Boxes* | Try typing your email & password, but watch them vanish... letter by letter. 😭 |
| 🎭 *Mood-Based Theme Selector* | A popup asks you about your feelings (because why not?) and changes the theme accordingly. 🎨✨ |
| 🚪 *Fake Login Button* | Clicking "Login"? LOL, it breaks instantly. 🪲💥 |
| 🍌 *Physics-Enabled Bananas* | Try to log in and get bombarded with flying bananas. Yes, physics included. 🍌🔄 |
| 😜 *Dynamic Emoji Reactions* | The emoji observes you... and reacts accordingly. Are you scared yet? 👀😈 |
| 💻 *Terminal for Commands* | Run `help`, `npm install`, and even `login` (if you can figure it out). 🖥️👨‍💻 |
| 🎆 *Trippy Banana Background* | Bananas. Everywhere. Moving. Hypnotizing. 🍌🍌🍌 |

## 🛠️ **How to "Solve" This Masterpiece**

So you actually want to **log in**? Brave soul. Here’s the step-by-step survival guide:

1. **Click "Sign In"** – Yes, we know, it’s broken. But bear with us.
2. **Open the Terminal** – Look for the small terminal icon in the corner. Click it.
3. **Type `npm install`** – This will "install" necessary packages (fake, obviously).
4. **Wait for Installation** – Enjoy the weird messages while packages are installing. 🛠️
5. **Follow the Hint!** – After installation, you'll see a hint with a login command format.
6. **Type `login jintu help404`** – This is the actual, real, working login. 🎉
7. **BOOM! You’re In!** – A *beautifully frustrating* success screen will appear. Congrats. 🎊🎭
